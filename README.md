# Project 1: [Directing Resources to Address COVID-19 Health Inequities](https://github.com/samzhang6/BA775-Team-Project-04/tree/main)

## Overview
Our goal is to establish a strategy for equal distribution of health care resources for the treatment of COVID-19. We will analyze the impact of inequities on community health status, find the hardest hit areas, and map out how to allocate medical resources (vaccines, tests, treatments, etc.) equally and to efficiently protect the safety of all communities.

# Project 2: [Spotify Song Popularity Prediction](https://github.com/samzhang6/BA810-Project/blob/main/Spotify_Song_Popularity_Prediction%20(1).ipynb)

## Overview
Spotify is the global leader in the streaming music sector, with over 456 million monthly active users, including 195 million paying subscribers. Our project goal is to evaluate machine learning models from Python to predict Spotify song popularity and identify what makes a song popular.

Music has become an integral to our life. For most people, it is part of their daily routine. However, this outbreak has increased our music listening activities. We aim to understand the features that popular songs have in common. Moreover, we’re interested in knowing if a song's artist, the genre of the song and the musical features like energy, loudness and danceability among others can help distinguish hit and non-hit songs.

Spotify is the music service that enables users to remotely source millions of different songs on various record labels from a laptop, smartphone or other device. To recommend new music to users and to be able to internally classify songs, Spotify assigns each song values from 20 different attributes/features. These features are mostly numerical values, but include some categorical data as well. Spotify also assigns each song a popularity score, based on total number of listens/clicks.

# Project 3: [Investigating pricing factors inside the Real Estate market of Brazil](https://github.com/samzhang6/BA780-Team-Project-B3/blob/main/B3-Investigating%20pricing%20factors%20inside%20the%20Real%20Estate%20market%20of%20Brazil.ipynb)

## Overview
A house is usually the most important purchase of an individual’s lifetime. With soaring prices and unpredictable factors such as socio-economic conditions as well as fraudulent listings, it is quite important to keep an objective eye in understanding the pricing landscape, which is what our analysis aims to achieve.

# Project 4: [Predicting Hospital Admission from Emergency Department Data Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/samzhang6/Predicting-Hospital-Admission-from-Emergency-Department-Data-Using-Machine-Learning)

## Overview 
To develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the probability of hospital admissions from ED with high accuracy. To identify and analyze the key predictors and features that significantly influence hospital admissions. To implement a real-time, user-friendly predictive tool for healthcare providers.

# Project 5: [Identifying Inefficiencies in Medicare Healthcare Resource Utilisation and Costs](https://github.com/samzhang6/BA843-Final-Project)

## Overview
One of the biggest and most intricate sectors in the world, the healthcare sector has a vast number of players and moving elements. In the US, millions of people with needs are covered by the government-funded Medicare insurance program. In order to detect potential inefficiencies and consider solutions for lowering healthcare costs while preserving the quality of treatment, it is critical to examine how hospital resources are used and the cost of care for Medicare inpatients and outpatients.
